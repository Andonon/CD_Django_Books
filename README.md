<h2>Assignment: Books</h2>
Create a new Django project and add a books model. Complete the below functionality.

<strong>1. Create Books model</strong><br>
Your model should contain the following fields: title, author, published date, category.

<strong>2. Migrate</strong><br>
Make your migrations and activate shell.

<strong>3. Create and show Books</strong><br>
Make 5 new books and retrieve them all, as before.

<strong>4. Add a new field</strong><br>
Add a field to your table called in_print. This should be a boolean field.

What should you do to see your changes reflected in your database table? You'll have to makemigrations and migrate again. Once you do, a prompt will walk you through filling in values for the existing entries. Why is this? Discuss with your cohort-mates. Ask an instructor if you and your friends can't work it out.
